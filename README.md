In this unofficial part 4 of the medical insurance project, I will apply my newfound knowledge 
of Python Lists to store insurance cost data in a list as well as compare **estimated** insurance 
costs to **actual** insurance costs.

## Note --

While insurance companies do use BMI (Body Mass Index) in their calculations, and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.
